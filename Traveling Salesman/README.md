Implemented hashmap, priority queues, and stacks, but the main one for this project was the graph 

This project was meant to take in a large csv file of US state capitals and the distance/time it would take to fly there from another capital.

The main points of this project was to read in the data from a csv file and create a graph from it, find a minimum spanning tree of that graph, and then find an approximate solution to the best path around all the cities. 
The final result was a collection of the edges to take in order to achieve the optimal solution.
