Implemented two searching algorithms: DFS and BFS using stack and queue data structures
Utilized the Javascript graphical interface

The classes created for this project were the Cell, CellQueue, Landscape, and GridSearch.

The results of the final simulation was a graphical visual of a grid with cells, either locked or free, that resembled a maze. 
A yellow line traces the solving algorithms as they attempt to find the target cell.
