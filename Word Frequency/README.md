Implemented binary search tree data structure in Java

The purpose of this project was to create a program that can take in a text file, analyze it, and then return the frequencies of each word using a BSTMap and WordCounter classes.

The final result of this project included taking in 8 text files of reddit comments in certain years and producing my own word count files that visually showed the word frequencies.
